## Where to find Custom Tables

On a phone, open the navigation drawer and tap TABLE EDITOR under Tools. On a tablet or desktop, select Custom Tables in the navigation rail, or in the Classic 6-Panel Layout (Desktop) click the Custom Tables icon button at the lower right.
> ### How to Unlock
  >  - Google Play, Amazon, and Apple App Store: requires an in‑app purchase to unlock Custom Tables.
  > - Itch.io and Microsoft Store (Windows): included with the higher‑priced purchase.

## Make your first Meaning table

1) On a phone, open the Oracle tab and tap the + button to start the Create Table wizard. On a tablet or desktop, select the first icon in the left sidebar (Meaning Tables) and click the + button below the icons.
2) Name it and pick a category from the list. To add a category of your own, create it first with the + button on the Category tab.
3) Set the range (for a first table, try 1–10 or 1–20)
4) Add your entries. In the phone wizard the app spreads them evenly across the range for you.
5) Optional: description, tags, translations. Only Event Focus tables and categories have an icon of their own.
6) Save and test by rolling

> ### Tips
> - Start small (1d6/1d10) and expand later to 1d100
> - Keep ranges continuous (no gaps/overlaps). The app validates this for you
> - Use Entry Links on an entry to roll on another table, on an Adventure List (Characters, Threads, or Features), or on a Custom List when that entry comes up.

## Make an Event Focus table

1) On a phone, open the Event tab and tap the + button. On a tablet or desktop, select the second icon in the left sidebar (Event Focus) and click the + button below the icons.
2) Range is typically 1–100 (percentile) but smaller ranges work too
3) Add entries that describe what kind of event happens (for example NPC Action or Move Toward A Thread).
4) Save and try a few test rolls

> ### Tip 
> After you create a table, open it and use Linked Tables on the Controls tab to roll other Meaning Tables every time this table is rolled. Use Entry Links to link a single entry to a table or a list.


## Built-in tables

You can edit a built-in table. The app saves your version separately and uses it in place of the original. To keep both, choose **Duplicate** from the table's menu and edit the copy. Resets do not remove your edits. To go back to the originals, use **Discard Edits to Built-in Tables** in Table Settings.

How you remove a table depends on where it came from:

- A built-in table you have not edited offers **Hide this table** instead of **Delete**. Hiding takes the table out of your lists, but no files are deleted. To bring it back, show it again from **Table Settings**.
- A built-in table you have edited offers **Delete my edited version**. The app removes your version and loads the original again. You can undo this.
- A table you created yourself offers **Delete**. You can undo this too.

## Translations & metadata

- You can add per‑table and per‑entry translations as you go. Default language is `en`.
- Add tags to help search and grouping.
- Icons are configured via categories; you can pick an icon per category once and reuse it.

## Starter downloads

Use these templates and samples as starting points. Import them from the Files tab in Custom Tables (the Import/Export icon on a tablet or desktop). Tap Oracle Tables for a Meaning Table file or Event Focus Tables for an Event Focus file. See the Downloads section below for files.

## Weighted tables

- You can't build a weighted table by hand yet. On the **Controls** tab, the **Weighted** option is marked **Coming Soon**.
- To get a weighted Meaning Table, import a Meaning Table CSV with result and weight columns, up to 100 rows. The app spreads the weights over 100 slots, so the weights it keeps can differ from the numbers in your file.
- When any entry in a Meaning Table has a weight above 1, the app picks an entry by weight and does not roll the table's linked tables. An Event Focus table always rolls on its ranges.
- Selecting **Roll Ranges** on the **Controls** tab splits the ranges again, but the weights stay. A weight above 1 still makes the app pick by weight.
